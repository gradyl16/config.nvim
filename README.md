# Dylen's Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration. It is a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

This is a **personal** configuration. It is not meant to be a general-purpose configuration. It is tailored to my needs and preferences. You are welcome to use it, but I make no guarantees that it will work for you. There are a lot of external dependencies, most of which I may not have documented here.

This document is a work in progress. It is not yet complete.
